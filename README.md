## What is does?

**AI-Powered Insights**: Our advanced ML and Deep Learning models analyze a vast range of interview-related data to provide tailored insights for each user's needs. This includes commonly asked questions, industry-specific trends, and personalized suggestions for improvement.


**Interview Simulation**: Experience simulated interview scenarios with our AI assistant. Receive real-time feedback on your responses, gaze attention and emotions and improve  your interview skills.

**Industry Relevance**: Whether you're pursuing a career in technology, finance, healthcare, or any other field, our AI assistant adapts its guidance to suit the specific requirements and expectations of your target industry.

**Continuous Refinement**: Our platform continually updates its insights and recommendations as interview trends evolve. This ensures that you're always equipped with the latest information and strategies to stand out in your interviews.
## Building Process

The following tech stacks were used in this product:

**Frontend**:
- ReactJS
- Tailwind CSS
- Sass

**Backend**:
- Flask

**Machine Learning**:
- Tensorflow
- OpenCV
- Python 

**Version Control**:
- Git 
- GitHub

**UI/UX**:

- Figma

We decided the plan of action and divided the wordload to go about in a systematic way and held frequent reviews amongst ourselves to check progress.

## Challenges 

- The main issues we faced were finding the datasets for training our Deep Learning Models.

- Integrating the backend with the frontend.

- Deploying the models and integrating them with the backend.

- Non-Availability of compatible hardware and software for training our models.
## Accomplishments

We our proud of putting this project together as a team. It was a great experience for all of us to learn new tech stacks.
A few things we overcome are:

- Increasing our CNN model's accuract from 26% to 77%.
- Building a backend using flask

## Learning Experience

- We learnt to work as a team in a systematic way. 
- How to use Git efficently 
- Integration and deployment of ML models on the website.
- UI/UX design


## Future of Colloquium.ai

We plan to work on our machine learning models and complete the functionality of the features and work on the backend.
